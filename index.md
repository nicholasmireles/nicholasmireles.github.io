Hello!

My name is Nicholas Mireles and I am a data engineer for Carnegie Mellon University. Working at such a great university has allowed  me to expand my knowledge in my specialties: machine learning and computer vision. My interests outside of work range from hiking to poetry to 3D Modeling. I hope to combine my interest in the arts and  sciences in a way that entertains and educates the world.
