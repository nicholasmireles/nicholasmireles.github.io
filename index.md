Hello!

My name is Nicholas Mireles and I am a computer engineer in the DC metro area. I am currently employed by a great company that has allowed me to expand my knowledge into areas such as machine learning and blockchain technology. My interests outside work range from hiking to poetry to 3D Modeling. I hope that I can combine my interest in the arts and sciences in a way that can entertain and educate the world.
