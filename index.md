Hello!

My name is Nicholas Mireles and I am a computer engineer in the DC metro area. I am currently employed by a great company that has allowed me to expand my knowledge into areas such as machine learning and front-end development. My interests outside work range from hiking to poetry to 3D Modeling. I hope to combine my interest in the arts and sciences in a way that entertains and educates the world.
