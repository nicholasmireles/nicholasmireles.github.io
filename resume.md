                                            Through my previous employer, Noblis, I was provided the opportunity to work
                                            on many advanced research projects. One such project that I was able to

                                            For this program, I developed a Python pipeline that enabled the flow of a
                                            large number of Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) to and from Amazon

                                            My participation in this challenge was funded via an internal research
                                            project at Noblis. Despite entering towards the latter half of the
                                            competition, our team managed to place within the top 6% of all

                                            For this project, my manager experimented with rotating tasks between pairs
                                            of programmers. As a result, I had the opportunity to contribute to many
                                            sides of this project. My first task was to implement basic computer vision
                                            functionality such as convex hull to clean up the data as well as the
                                            ability to render 2D views of the 3D data at arbitrary angles. I also
                                            developed the evaluation harness for the final testing of the model
                                            developed by our team before submission.</p>

                                        My main project at the National Robotics Engineering Center is a
                                        collaboration with
                                        the Army AI Task Force to develop a cooperative and autonomous off-road
                                        vehicle and
                                        drone with threat recognition capability. This project has proved to be
                                        an
                                        interesting challenge as we push the limits of ML inference time on
                                        constrained
                                        hardware capabilities.</p>

                                        <br>
                                        For this project, I have developed a data pipeline and artifact manager,
                                        written
                                        mostly in Python. This pipeline is capable of the following:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Preparing raw data coming off our custom hardware for manual data
                                            segmentation.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Generating Jira tickets for the labeler in charge of the
                                            segmentation.</li>
                                        <li>Uploading these new segments to a data annotation tool for a team of
                                            labelers to
                                            generate segmentation and object detection annotations, both 2D and
                                            3D.</li>
                                        <li>Generating datasets for researchers to train and evaluate new
                                            models.</li>
                                        <li>Automatic testing and evaluation of these new models.</li>
                                        <li>Tracking of the artifacts of all the above steps in a PostgreSQL
                                            database.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    I have also contributed to the C++ code base that runs on the vehicle itself
                                    by
                                    implementing an image stitching tool using OpenCV for visualization as well
                                    as
                                    integrating a Tensorflow implementation of the YOLOv3 model for a baseline
                                    detection
                                    model. Other minor tasks include creating a tool for extracting raw and
                                    rectified images
                                    and point clouds from the raw data in support of the aforementioned data
                                    pipeline.</p>
