            <p class="mt-0">The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers is an organization that is very near and dear to my heart. I was a member and eventually president of my university's chapter for all four years. I had many great experiences, and was afforded many great opportunities through them. SHPE's mission is to changes lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support, and development.
