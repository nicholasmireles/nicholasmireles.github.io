            <p class="mt-0">The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers is an organization that is very near and dear to my heart. I was a member and eventually president of my university's chapter for all four years. I had many great experiences, and was afforded many great opportunities through them. SHPE's mission is to changes lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support, and development. You can find out more about them <a href="https://www.shpe.org/">here!</a></p>

            <p class="mt-0">The Electronic Frontier Foundation is the leading nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world. Founded in 1990, EFF champions user privacy, free expression, and innovation through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism, and technology development. They work to ensure that rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our use of technology grows. As I've grown, especially in my career, I have learned the many ways that our rights and freedoms are eroded daily by commercial and government entities worldwide. I have also found that the average person is unaware of such erosions or the implications thereof. With that in mind, I am happy to have found an organization that pushes so hard for protective measures and legislative action.
