So, as one might notice by the timestamps on these posts, my interest in developing this series has fallen by the wayside. If you actually have a genuine interest in me continuing what I have here, feel free to reach out to me and let me know!

Otherwise, this incomplete series will stand as a monument to all those forgotten passion projects we all have gathering dust somewhere.
