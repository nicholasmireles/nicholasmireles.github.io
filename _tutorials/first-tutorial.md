[Here](https://github.com/nicholasmireles/tutorials/tree/master/introduction) you can find a tutorial that I wrote as an introduction to some of the fundamental concepts for machine learning.

I presented it this way because, as an interactive learner, I think Jupyter notebooks are a great way to learn a new concept. GitHub also makes it great by allowing you to run them in-browser.

The content from this tutorial is mostly knowledge that I learned from Andrew Ng's [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), which I highly recommend.

As always, I welcome any feedback on this tutorial and any recommendations for further topics.
